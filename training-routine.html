          <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Professional Valorant players don't become champions through casual play. They follow structured training routines designed to develop specific skills and maintain peak performance. This guide outlines a daily practice schedule that mirrors pro player training regimens.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-title">The Pro Practice Framework</h2>
          <p>
            Elite players dedicate 6-8 hours daily to competitive gaming, structured into focused practice sessions. Each session targets specific skill development:
          </p>
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li>Aim training and mechanics (1-1.5 hours)</li>
            <li>Ranked matchmaking (2-3 hours)</li>
            <li>Team scrimmages (2-3 hours)</li>
            <li>VOD review and analysis (1 hour)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This structure maximizes learning while maintaining focus and preventing burnout.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Phase 1: Warm-Up & Aim Training (30 minutes)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>What to Do:</strong> Start your session with aim trainer warmups. Use Valorant's practice range or AimLab to target specific weapon spray patterns and flick accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Exercises:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li>Free-for-all deathmatch (warm up reflexes)</li>
            <li>Spray control drills (Phantom and Vandal patterns)</li>
            <li>Flick shots (random targets)</li>
            <li>Tracking practice (moving targets)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Spend 30 minutes here before ranked play. Your warm-up determines how sharp your aim is during competitive matches.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Phase 2: Ranked Grinding (2-3 hours)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Play with focus on game sense and decision-making, not just mechanics.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Key Areas:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li>Crosshair placement and pre-aiming</li>
            <li>Map control and positioning</li>
            <li>Economy management</li>
            <li>Teammate communication</li>
            <li>Reading enemy patterns</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Play with intention. After each match, mentally note what you did well and what needs improvement. Take a 5-minute break every hour.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Phase 3: Team Scrimmages (2-3 hours)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Ranked play teaches individual skill, but team scrimmages teach coordination, meta execution, and high-pressure performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Focus Areas:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li>Executing team strategies</li>
            <li>Communication during executes</li>
            <li>Adapting to enemy playstyles</li>
            <li>Playing under pressure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you're not on a team, join competitive 5-stack groups or participate in online tournaments.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Phase 4: VOD Review (30-60 minutes)</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The Learning Phase:</strong> Review your matches and identify mistakes. This is where massive improvements happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What to Analyze:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="article-list">
            <li>Deaths — Why did you die? What angle was wrong?</li>
            <li>Positioning — Could you have been in a better spot?</li>
            <li>Utility Usage — Did you waste abilities?</li>
            <li>Decision-Making — Should you have pushed or held?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Spend time on losses more than wins. That's where improvement lives.
          </p>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Sample Daily Schedule</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>9:00 AM - 9:30 AM:</strong> Aim training and warmup<br/>
            <strong>9:30 AM - 12:30 PM:</strong> Ranked grind (3 hours)<br/>
            <strong>12:30 PM - 1:30 PM:</strong> Lunch break<br/>
            <strong>1:30 PM - 4:30 PM:</strong> Team scrimmages (3 hours)<br/>
            <strong>4:30 PM - 5:30 PM:</strong> VOD review and analysis<br/>
            <strong>5:30 PM +:</strong> Streaming/content creation or rest
          </p>
          <p>
            Adjust based on your schedule, but maintain consistent focus during each training phase.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2 class="section-title">Rest and Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Pro players take 1-2 days off per week to recover. Mental fatigue decreases decision-making quality. If you're playing tired, you're forming bad habits. Rest improves performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, proper sleep (8 hours), nutrition, and exercise directly impact gaming performance. Don't neglect these fundamentals.
